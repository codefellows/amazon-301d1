# Class 09: Cache Invalidation

## Overview
Today, we will discuss the concept of cache invalidation while deeply reviewing a completed version of the city explorer backend and frontend.  We will focus on expanding your knowledge of the WRRC and database integration and how that is designed and controlled within a CRUD application such as City Explorer.

## Learning Objective

As a result of completing Lecture 9 of Code 301, students will:
- Continue to expand on their understanding of SQL databases and interactions with third-party APIs
- Have a clear understanding of how a JS based, multiple resource, full-stack web application is designed and built at a fundamental level
